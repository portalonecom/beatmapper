Beatmapper is a _map editor_ for Beat Saber, a VR rhythm game. It allows you to create your own maps, for use in the game.

### Status: On hold

Unfortunately, I've had to put Beatmapper on the back burner. I do hope to resume work on this project in the future, but for now, you may wish to use an alternative editor.

At the time of writing (February 2021), I was able to create, test, and publish a map, but I know some folks have had issues, and I don't have the bandwidth to explore them right now. So **please do test that your map works on your headset** before sinking a lot of time and effort into it!

### Getting started

Beatmapper works entirely in-browser; there is nothing to download, nor is there a backend. You can get started now at https://beatmapper.app. On your first visit, you'll be able to play around with a demo song, to get a feel for the editor.

Documentation is available [at beatmapper.app/docs](https://beatmapper.app/docs/docs/manual.html).

### Donations

Beatmapper is a single-person side-project. I've already invested many, many, many hours in it. If you derive value from it, I'd appreciate donations:

- [One-time donation](https://ko-fi.com/joshwcomeau)
- [Become a patron](https://www.patreon.com/joshwcomeau)

### Why?

There are several editors already in existence, including an official one. Why make another one?

- Cross-platform support. This editor is the only editor that works on MacOS and Linux (some other editors don't even work in a Windows VM!)
- Get started effortlessly. Requires <1mb of total download including assets. It even comes with a demo track, so you can start playing around immediately.
- No "memes".
- Full compatibility. Beatmapper exports both available Beat Saber file formats, which means you can transfer exported maps directly to your Beat Saber device, or import them into other editors. You can also import existing maps in both formats.

I'm creating Beatmapper primarily for myself, for fun. Bug reports and feature requests are appreciated, but please understand, **I work on this when I want to**. If you don't like the editor, you do not have to use it.
